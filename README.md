Overview

This project consists of 20 distinct problems, ranging from basic scatter plots to complex multi-subplot visualizations and data parsing. These problems are ideal for anyone looking to improve their skills in:
	•	Data visualization using matplotlib
	•	Parsing and handling TSV/CSV datasets using pandas
	•	Applying mathematical concepts for visualization

Key Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are used throughout the project:
	•	math: For mathematical computations like trigonometry and factorials.
	•	matplotlib: To create various visualizations (scatter plots, line charts, histograms, etc.).
	•	pandas: For reading, manipulating, and parsing CSV/TSV files.

Problems and Solutions

Visualization Problems

	1.	Scatter Plot: Visualize (x, y) coordinates in a scatter plot using plt.scatter.
	2.	Line Plot: Generate a line plot for (x, y) data.
	3.	Comparative Line Charts: Plot two datasets (e.g., strawberries and bananas) on a shared x-axis.
	4.	Subplots: Separate comparative data into two subplots (e.g., strawberries and bananas over time).
	5.	Title Extraction: Identify the title of a given chart based on plt.title.

Mathematical and Advanced Plotting

	6.	Range and Variation: Customize axis ranges to highlight variations in data.
	7.	Transformations: Apply transformations to (x, y) coordinates (e.g., flipping horizontally/vertically).
	8.	Multiple Subplots: Plot three subplots for different datasets with customized axes.
	9.	Chart Count: Analyze and count the number of charts generated using plt.subplot.

Algorithmic Data Visualization

	10.	Collatz Sequence: Extend and visualize a Collatz sequence as a line chart.
	11.	Datasaurus Visualization: Create a scatter plot of the famous “Datasaurus” dataset.
	12.	Sorting and Plotting: Sort unsorted data and plot it using a line chart.

Parsing and Advanced Subplotting

	13.	Data Series Count: Count the number of data series in a given chart.
	14.	Save Chart: Save a line chart to a file (e.g., p14.png).
	15.	Binomial Distribution: Visualize the binomial distribution using math.comb.

Histograms and Factorial Visualization

	16.	Histogram: Plot the frequency distribution of a dataset using plt.hist.
	17.	Factorial Visualization: Plot factorial values with a log scale for the y-axis.

TSV Data Parsing and Visualization

	18.	Animal Data: Divide data by categories (e.g., animals) and plot each in a subplot.
	19.	Abalone Dataset: Visualize abalone length and diameter using a scatter plot.
	20.	Color-Coded Scatter Plot: Plot x, y values with color codes from a TSV file.

How to Use

Prerequisites

	•	Install Python 3.x.
	•	Ensure matplotlib and pandas are installed:

pip install matplotlib pandas



Running the Code

	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-visualization-project.git
cd data-visualization-project


	2.	Run individual problems as Python scripts:

python problem1.py


	3.	For file-based problems, ensure that required files (e.g., f11.csv, f18.tsv, f20.tsv) are in the same directory as the script.
